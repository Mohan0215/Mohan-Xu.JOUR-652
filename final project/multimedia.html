<p>Most college students face stress, but international students facing even more challenges and stresses because they moving away from home, seeing new people and knowing different cultures.</p>

<p>There are several reasons causing international students to experience pressure and stress, such as culture shock and general school anxiety. This stress can be compounded based on how students were taught to handle stress in their native culture.</p>

<p>Yi-Jiun Lin, an assistant director for the Counseling Service at UMD, agreed. “If we are talking about acculturative stress, then yes, research shows that international students in the U.S. experience higher acculturative stress than domestic students,” she said.</p>

<p>Lin explained the acculturative stress typically comes from cross-cultural adjustment process and is related to their academic, social and emotional adjustment and functioning.</p>

  <h1>Interview</h1>
<p>Zhixuan Yu, a senior communication major from China, says that high expectations of grades and performance are the root of much of her stress.</p>
<p>Some of those high expectations come from parents and social groups. However, Yu believed self expectations are the foremost expectation driving her stress.</p>

<p>Yu says that because she has access to resources which means both her parents and UMD provided opportunities to her, so she wants to get better results.</p>

<p>Counseling Center’s Training Director David Petersen seconded Yu’s thoughts.“The pressure to perform well is higher for international students because that’s the reason why there are here,” Petersen said. </p>

<p>He continued to explain that international students have to work hard and staying here requires them to study hard. As Yu said studying, and especially finals are a challenging time.</p>

<p>In addition, Yu also wants to balance studying with a social life, which adds to her stress. UMD has an organization called “Chinese Students and Scholars Association.” Yu is one of the E-Board members and needs to do a lot of things.</p>

<p>The third point of pressure and stress is language barriers. Sometimes Yu still cannot understand classes very well. Yu explained that she is more comfortable talking to Chinese students rather than American students. “Sometimes I am too shy to talk to native speakers,” Yu said.</p>

<p>Petersen also confirmed that language is connected to international students’ pressure and stress.</p>

<p>He provided some examples about international students, such as “it is stressful for international students to raise hands in classes.”</p>

<p>These accumulated pressures and stresses are part of what drove Yu to start smoking last semester.</p>

<p>However, not all international students face the problems in the same way. In contrast to Yu, Praneeth Babu Yaramosu, a business analytics graduate student from India, experiences pressure and stress differently. He feels he can handle school life pressure and stress well because of his Indian background. He was more comfortable in English and always prepared very well.</p>

<p>“My pressure is about my future career and how to find a place for me in society,” he said.</p>

<p>In addition to Yu and Yaramosu’s thoughts on the sources and aspects of their pressure, Petersen believed that loneliness and homesickness are also factors that influence international students’ pressure and stress. For international students, it is difficult and less possible for them to visit home often because of time and money. Also, Petersen said the lack of support system is a factor influencing international students to have stress.</p>

<h1>Coping With Stress</h1>
<p>According to Inside Higher Ed, “Research suggests that international students are less likely than domestic students to seek mental health treatment -- or even be aware of the availability of services.”</p>
<p>Yu always has ways of coping with stress, but going to counseling is not something that she would pursue. She chooses to watch television series or looking at idols’ performances or eats a lot or playing with her cats. </p>

<p>If Yaramosu experiences stress, he plays an online game called “Defense of the Ancients.</p>

<p>In addition, Yu added, “I feel more American students seek help in the counseling center compared to international students.”</p>

<p>Yu is correct. International students make up a small portion of the students who seek help in the UMD counseling center. 10% identify as international students, 50% are white students and 21% are Asian American students.</p>

<p>However, Petersen believed that 10% is a pretty good number for a minority population to come because “I am pleased that international students are aware of our services and believe that seeking help is a good idea.”</p>

<p>UMD is not the only school that international students facing stresses and go to the Counseling Center. Other schools, such as University of Michigan, Kansas State University, Texas A&M University.</p>

<p>“I think sometimes people have misunderstandings about what happened,” Petersen said. “Getting support is helping you [students]think about different perspectives and if there is some strategies that can be helpful.”</p>

<p>Dougherty said, “The level of reported stress may also be impacted by cultural reticence to admit to stress,”</p>

<p>That’s why some international students deny to seek help in the Counseling Center because they believed that stress is a personal weakness rather than illness.</p>

<p>More broadly, Center for Collegiate Mental Health at Penn State (CCMH) provides more statistics to show that international students would not like to seek help in the Counseling Center.</p>

<h2>The growing stress problem at universities</h2>
<p> Center for Collegiate Mental Health at Penn State (CCMH)is an international practice-research network. Each year, they gathered data from more than 100 universities and colleges Counseling
centers to understand students mental health. Here, students are defined as students receiving mental health services. The Following two charts explained how many students suffered from stress and
percentage of international students who seeking mental health services.The first chart visulize the growing number of people attending counseling centers.
N represents the number of clinicians who are were to choose one primary concern (for example, the top-most concern) per client. Each year, stress was the top four conern. However, the percentage of stress was different. It was 5.9%, 5.5%, 5.7% and 5.8% between 2015 and 2018.</P>

<h2>The percentage of international students who seek mental health treatments during 2014 and 2015</h2>
<p> Students who have been asked the question,"Are you International Students?"
CCMH explained that "The SDS contains a number of “core” or required items as well as a larger number of
optional items that are typically asked of students seeking services. Because counseling
centers vary in the types of questions they ask, the total number of responses varies by
question." Therefore, N was different.

<p>“The university is aware of the unique challenges and issues our international students face,” Lin added.</p>

<p>International students have multiple choices to seek various services at the Counseling Center, such as International Student Support Group, anxiety/depression workshops, individual counseling, according to Lin.</p>

<p>Petersen is the facilitator for the International Student Support Group (ISSG). Students came together and had discussions with each other. As Peterson said the purpose of International Student Support Group is to “calm down.” Therefore, he said it is okay to come here only because students feel lonely or having trouble with professors.</p>

<p>ISSG does not always have a big group compared to three or four years ago, according to Petersen. Asian students such as China and South Korea students come here frequently compared to other nationalities.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Petersen mentioned that the Counseling Center provides individual counseling and career counseling to international students.</p>

 <p>In addition, Lin explained that different departments also provide services and help to international students through examples.</p>

 <p>She said campus provides training to faculty and staff to increase their understanding and sensitivity of unique issues/challenges faced by international students as they work with them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the ISSS also “trained its staff to recognize the symptoms of stress and the cultural differences in how stress may present in an individual” Susan Ellis Dougherty, UMD’s International Student & Scholar Services’s advisor said.</p>

<p>Besides, Dougherty said ISSS also work with the Counseling Center and Health Center to offer workshops on “stress management, raise awareness of academic and personal stress, and refer international students to resources on campus and in the community for support in managing stress.”</p>
